    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like.

    "### Multi-layer Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    " -  MLP is a neural network algorithm that is widely used in the manufacturing for real-time process monitoring [1, 2]. The main reason that motivates different researcher to use this algorithm is the possibility to make predictions in real-time [1,2,3]. For example, in order to change cutting tools on CNC machine at the right time (avoid tool wear or damage, and don't change too early), there is a need of the real-time monitoring system with integrated sensors that will tell an operator when to change a tool (e.g.,tool wear % - if more it reaches 85 % for this product, operator need to change it. Different products may have different quality requirements and thus different thresholds for tool wear. The main interest is processing a data collected from one or more sensors (vibration sensor, ecoustic emmision, force sensor, etc.) and predicting tool wear in real time. The first step in such decision-making system starts with experimental work to collect a data, which then will be used to train a model. Features extraction is one of the major steps that will influence the performance of the model and computational time. Based on the choosen features, model is trained in accordance to targets provided by experienced operator. In other words, when experiments are performed, advanced operator tells when tool should be changed. Since advanced operator have implicit knowledge and experience, machine learning algorithm can be used to utilize this knowledge and pass to a younger unexperienced operator. Then trained model is used during manufacturing process.\n",
    " \n",
    " - This algorithm is capable of learning complex non-linear models [3]. The number of hyperparameters that could be tuned, I would call, as both advantage and disadvantage. Hyperparameters are mentioned as disadvantage in [3], though. The reason why I consider hyperparameters as advantage is due to possibility of controling the complexity of the model (linear regression is ususally cannot deal with 103 features and will poorly connect them with the target values), in MLP we can choose the type of solver that will describe data the best. In addition, MLP can deal with model complexity and many features that is very important for our case.\n",
    " \n",
    " - The number of hyperparameters is also a disadvantage, since it can be hard to find an optimal combination. In addition, there is high possibility of finding local minimum, since MLP uses a non-convex loss function [3]. MLP is sensitive to feature scaling, however aplication of L2 regularization may help to overcome this issue [3]. Possible presence of Type 1 and Type 2 errors.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Since in our case we have 103 features and these features may have non-linear correlation, MLP will be able to fit data to the target. If overfitting is observed, then L2 regularization should be implemented as well. There is also possibility of using different solvers, and linear regression is also listed. Therefore, using MLP will allow us to find model that will be right for our data and don't make it too complex.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Support vector Machines\n",
    "\n",
    " - Support Vector Machines is one of the widely used methods in financial market predictions [4]. This article compared performance of MLP with SVM to predict financial bankruptcy. Since SVM was capable of extracting optimal solutions without deriving weights of network, its performance were found to be better [5]. The authors have reasoned this conclusion as the finding hyperparameters of MLP is an art. Another application area is a manufacturing, recognizing shifts in both correlated and non-correlated manufacturing processes for autocorrelated data, which is timeseries.  \n",
    " \n",
    " - SVM can minimize both Type 1 and Type 2 errors [5]. Thealgorithm is effective when number of dimensions is higher than number of sample, is also effective in high dimensional spaces, versatile (different krnels are provided or a customized one can be created) and memory efficient (uses subsets of a data for training model) [6]. Application of cross-validation can also be named as advantage, although it is in the list of dissadvantages in [6]. Five-cross validation tecgnique allow us to utilize data in more efficient way (especially important for small datasets) and at the same time to prevent overfitting problem.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Five cross-validation technique, which is used in SVM to calculate probability estimates, can be considered as disadvantage because it is expensive [6]. In the case when number of features is higher than number of sample, it is very hard to overcome the overfitting proble, and thus tuning hyperparameters of the model is crucial task [6]. \n",
    " \n",
    " - Since in our case, number of features is much smaller than number of samples and therefore the tuning of hyperparameters will not be that crucial. Even more, the choice of proposed kernel can provide a possibility of greater results. In addition, this method is memory efficient, and thus should spent less time for training a model. \n",
    " \n",
    "### AdaBoost\n",
    "\n",
    " - AdaBoost as well as other ML tehniques is widely used in different industry. For example, for medical application it can be used to extract liver lesion from CT volume [8]. Te main interest of this application is high accuracy that couldn't be achieved with other methods but AdaBoost showed much better performance. Another interesting application is a vehicle detection [7]. The authors proposed a real-time vision-based vehicle's rear detection system using gradient based methods and Adaboost classification [7].\n",
    " \n",
    " - Adjustes weights of inccorectly classified instances [9], thus leads to a better result. AdaBoost uses many weak learner to compile one strong in the results, and thus \"pseudo-loss measure may make it easier for the weak learner to get a weak advantage\" (predicting that instance doesn't belong to a specific class even though weak learner doesn't know to which class it belongs, and covering this issue in the next round [10]. Using differnt types of base estimators is also an advantage. It is lesslikely to overfitt data comparing with other methods.\n",
    " \n",
    " - It is sensitive to outliers and noisy data [11]. Bif choice of base estimators may lead to difficulties of tuning the hyperparameters.\n",
    " \n",
    " - AdaBoost is great for this case because throught he choice of right base estimator, we will be able to fit data with high accuracy. Many weak learns may help to compose a strong learner in the end with low risk of overfitting.\n",

    "**Answer: ** AdaBoost classifier is te best model among all testes, since it has both the highest F_score for testing when 100% training data is used and it is the fastet algorithm when both training and testing time is considred. For example, MVC model requires over 80 sec to thrain data and about 15 sec for testing, while MLP need about 25 sec for training, and between 0 and 1 sec to train data. Even though, MLP is the fastet to test data, training time is still larger then AdaBoost Classifier (training time is less than 5 sec). In addition, AdaBoost classifier needs a bit more time for testing, but it is still less than 1 sec. So in terms of time Ada Boost is the best among others. \n",
    "\n",
    "When to ook on the F_score for training and testing, MLP and Ada boost are again very close to each other. However, AdaBoost Classifier has larger F_score on testing data than MLP, and it is much closer to the F_score on training data. Thus, we can conclude that this model is good in terms of generalization, doesn't underfit not overfit the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering the type of data we are uzing to develop model, AdaBoost is a good choice since this algorithm make predictions based on the ensemble of weak learns. This algorithms works good even for smaller datasets, and showed stable performance for all three sample sizes."

Since occupation by itself can help to assume the level of the income, if it is supported by capital_gain (how much person earns), and education_num, which describes level of education and also influence income of the person, to estimate person's income with higher accuracy will be easier. In addition, information about hours_per_week could tell us how much time person can spend at work, which gives us better overview of his future income.

    "**Answer:** I have guessed correctly just three of 5 features, and correct order for those three (capital gain was followed by hours per week and education). However, their importance is lower than i expected. Besides, Capital_loss and age were two parameters that I looked at and couldn't see any pattern that connects them to the target. So my intuition was not that good as the number of data is larger than my mind can process, and therefore it was hard to connect them. I also assumed that age is not difining how much people earn. Capital_loss is important for the model, bu I personally thought that capital gain is more important, however it could be that persons who gain a lot can spend even more, so it could be reasonable to have it as important parameter."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
